# Tetris Project

### Introduction:
This is our first collaboration project using Git.
That's why we had decided to start easily by doing an easy game such as Tetris.

### How it works?
Simply use your Python interpreter on the `main.py` file.
PyQt5 is required in order to launch the code.
If you are on windows, you can simply type the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install pyqt5
```

### Controls:
Simply use the arrow keys in order to move, the up key is to rotate.
